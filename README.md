## Setup requirements

- Set up [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion AI Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).
  - AIYA is currently tested on commit `2c1bb46c7ad5b4536f6587d327a03f0ff7811c5d` of the Web UI.
- Run the Web UI as local host with api (`COMMANDLINE_ARGS= --listen --api`).
- Clone this repo.
- See [Setting up a Discord Bot](https://github.com/killfrenzy96/AiyaFrenzyBot/wiki/Setting-up-a-Discord-Bot) to obtain a Discord bot token.
- Create a text file in your cloned repo called ".env", formatted like so:
```dotenv
# .env
TOKEN = put your bot token here
```
- Run AIYA by running launch.bat (or launch.sh for Linux)

## Usage

To generate an image from text, use the /dream command and include your prompt as the query.

## Modifications from AIYABOT

This is modified from AIYABOT for my Discord server. The goal of these modifications is to make the bot more useful for refining images.

I have also removed many sources of delay and added support for multiple AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI instances, which allows this bot to generate images significantly faster, especially if multiple people are using this bot.

Interactions have been enhanced to make the bot easier to use for users who do not like to type in commands.

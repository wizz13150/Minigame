I hope you like what I've done.
Please don't judge me.
Forgive me for what I have done.
These drawings are great! I think...
I've purposely messed this up for you.
You thought I'd make it easy for you?
This may not be at all what I thought it was.
I've messed up, haven't I?
Why was this prompt even chosen?
I don't know what I've just done.
This was completely what I intended to draw...
I've just been doing the art for a while.
This is just the beginning.
What have I done? This is a mistake...
These drawings are great!
I hope you think my drawings are amazing!
What am I even doing? I don't know, you can figure that out.
These drawings are not my problem now.
This wasn't even my first mistake.
I've done my art on a regular basis.
You know what? I'm so sorry.
If you think this was a mistake, you're probably right.
This is my way of thinking.
I don't really know what I'm doing.
There are a lot of problems with the drawing.
These drawings are all I can think of.
It's really hard to come up with a good drawing.
I don't know what this is. Please forgive me.
I've just done a bunch of random things.
Good luck trying to guess this one.
Have a look at my lovely drawings.
